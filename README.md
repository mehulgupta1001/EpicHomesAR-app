  1. Press `Windows + R` on your keyboard
  2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
  3. You'll see a black window - that's Command Prompt!

#### Important Terms
- **Installing:** Like downloading an app on your phone, but for your computer
- **WiFi Network:** The internet connection your devices use
- **Repository:** Where the app's code is stored online (like a folder in the cloud)
- **QR Code:** A square barcode that your phone can scan
- **Dependencies:** Extra pieces of code our app needs to work

#### Tips for Success
- Follow steps in exact order
- Don't skip any steps
- If something doesn't work, try closing everything and starting fresh
- Keep this guide open while you work
